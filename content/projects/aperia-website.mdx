## Problem
Previously, Aperia uses Squarespace to create websites, which has a many limits to publish content (especially job hiring posts and career applications). Also, after a rebranding of Aperia, the old website doesn’t match the current brand guideline. 

As a result, we decided to create a new version of the Aperia website.

## Designing

I help the branding team with website style library setup and overall website structure & layout. Also, I provide responsive treatments for pages.

## Implementing

### Backend

We decided to use WordPress CMS for its easy-to-use admin panel and make use of its plugins. I create a WordPress theme from scratch with custom post types like Career, Product, Service, and Insight,… with custom taxonomies like Location, Department (used for Career).

</Box>
</ContentNode>

### Frontend

The website uses Tailwind CSS for CSS framework. Also, Gulp, Rollup, and SWC are used as build tools.

## Tracking

I worked with Admin team to set up Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics for the website.

## Launching & results

I worked with IT team to deploy the website into production. I installed some plugins like Rank Math for SEO, BackWPup for backing up. To optimize website performance, I set up:

- Cache optimization (using [Cache Enabler](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cache-enabler/) plugin)
- CDN (use [KeyCDN](https://www.keycdn.com/))
- Asset Minification (using [Autoptimize](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autoptimize/))

Furthermore, I conduct training for HR team on how to post jobs on websites and create career filters (taxonomies).

The final result is a website with better content, layout, and content management system (especially for hiring). You could see it live at [https://aperia.com](https://aperia.com).
