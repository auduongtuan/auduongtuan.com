## ‚ÅâÔ∏è Problem

Today, the rising number of motorbikes in Vietnam leads to various issues. One of them is current motorbikes parking systems, which have many problems such as vulnerable parking cards, difficulty to find a park, insecurity and only-cash payment. I wonder why dont we use smartphones, which are popular devices in Vietnam to solve these problems. This app is my scientific thesis project in school to make a low-cost, card-free, secure and convenient parking system.

## üßë User Research

We had a survey to 132 people who was students and office workers in Ho Chi Minh City about how often they use mobile phones, what operating systems they have, what problems they face when using our current parking systems, do they have a vehicle registration certificate,‚Ä¶

From the insights from that survey, we concluded a general persona for this app:

## üß† Solving Problem

Having been thinking deeply, I had a concept for this new system. There are 2 apps for this system: one for parking user and one for parking owner, just like Grab or Uber. QR Code is the chosen method to share secured data between them (like Momo wallet). The system will use Google Maps to locate and seek for available and closest parks. The payment system using credit cards and e-wallets is also provided.

For the case that there is an user having not installed the app or forgotten to bring phones, the backup method is an device that can store and display QR Code. In this way, park owner has one more step of capturing vehicle's license plate for comparing when the user checks out.

## üëè Conclusion

The solution could achieve the goals of making it low-cost, card-free, secure and convenient system. However, it still has some issues to set up widely due to laws, people awareness and privacy. Therefore, when coming to real life, it could be set up at some companies and schools at the first stage before widening.
