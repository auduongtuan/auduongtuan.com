The way I got into the design and tech industry is straightforward but tortuous.

## The beginning
My journey in the digital world started in 2009 when I learned Photoshop and CSS on my own to make Yahoo! blog themes. Then, I acquired skills in PHP, WordPress, and Javascript to create websites and me and friends as a hobby.

## From hobby to professional
After high-school graduation in 2013, it’s hard for me to choose between the art side and the tech side (there is no in-between field like HCI in Vietnam at that time). I signed up for both Software Engineering and Graphic Design in the college entrance exam and luckily passed both. Finally, I chose Design school because think it is fun and the environment is more open-minded.
Although the curriculum is more about traditional graphic design than digital media, I learned how to research thoroughly, think critically and present my ideas. Also, design principles, knowledge about typography, layout, and animation are absorbed through internal and external courses.
I remained interested in programming to create real functional interactive products. It helped me a lot when working for freelance customers or volunteer projects when I was in my UAH.

## Broaden my world
After graduated university and having worked in the UX field for a time, although knowing to code enough for the job, I always felt unfulfilled that I’m lack some tech fundamentals. Therefore, I signed up for my second degree in tech at HCMUS and am currently on my way to pursuing it.
During this time, my programming skill is improved a lot. I learned a lot of data structure and algorithms, got used to React, Typescript, and modern front-end technologies.
